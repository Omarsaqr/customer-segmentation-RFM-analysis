Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis & K-Means Clustering
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to segment customers and generate actionable business insights. Using both RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering, we identify different customer groups and provide recommendations for marketing and business strategy.

The goal is to combine business intuition (RFM) with machine learning (K-Means) for a balanced and data-driven segmentation approach.
